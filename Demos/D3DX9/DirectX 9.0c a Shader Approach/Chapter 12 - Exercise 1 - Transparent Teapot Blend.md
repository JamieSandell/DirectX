The Transparent Teapot demo uses the source and destination blend factors used in Blend Factor Example 4 (ยง12.2.4) to achieve transparency.
Modify the Transparent Teapot demo to use the source and destination factors used in Blend Factor Example 1 (ยง12.2.1), Blend Factor Example 2
(ยง12.2.2), and Blend Factor Example 3 (ยง12.2.3). You should experiment further with the other possible blend combinations. In addition, experiment
with different D3DBLENDOP settings. Lastly, try out the D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE render state by only rendering to the green color channel.
