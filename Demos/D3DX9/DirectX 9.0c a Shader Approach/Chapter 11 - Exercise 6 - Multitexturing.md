In this chapter's demo directory there are two textures, as shown in the left and middle images of Figure 11.20. Use multi-texturing to combine
them together to produce the image at the right in Figure 11.20. In addition, animate the flare by rotating it as a function of time (rotate the color
and grayscale textures at different rates). Display the resultant texture on each face of a cube. (Hint: The center in texture coordinates is not the
origin; it is (1/2, 1/2), and thus the rotation will be off because the rotation equations rotate about (0, 0). Therefore, you will need to first translate
the texture coordinates so that the center is at the origin, apply the rotation transformation, and then translate back so that the center is back at
(1/2, 1/2) for texturing.)
